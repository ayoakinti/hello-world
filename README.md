# hello-world

Hello!!

I'm new here; exploring a world of possibilities as a software developer.
I really want to improve and I can't wait to add some real value to the world.

The journey gets scary sometimes, but my whole trust is on God, and with Him, I believe I would win big time as a developer.
In a few years time, I would be sought after by so many big shots all around the world.

I would be a big shot soon; but I know it won't come on a platter of gold; I need determination, focus, resilence, and consistency. 

Thank you.
Ayomide Akintimehin Olawale.
